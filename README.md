# EnglishExercices

This project is a personal project which I made in order to learn how create a website, deploy it and connect different users.

This project consists in a set of multiple English Exercices/Games to help learn some vocabulary online.

You can use it in [**THIS**](hhttps://english-exercices.herokuapp.com/) link

### Development

It consists on a both server and client-side programming web service, which is (partially) responsive.

For some exercice, as it's needed, it allows you to play with some other player using **RESTFUL** services.

**It's is recommendable to play it in a PC browser** service since, as commented previously, the responsiveness is not working optimally.
